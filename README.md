It comes as no surprise that failure to accommodate hearing impaired people and the lack of an effective communication methodology adds to loneliness, social anxiety and depression amongst these people. Hearing Assistant is a real time speech to text converter which enables hearing disabled people communicate with the outside world. The project comprises a GUI (Graphic User Interface) which provides a ‘Record Voice Button’ and an ‘Exit Button’. The Record Voice Button enables a person to record his or her voice/ message which is then displayed on the GUI for the hearing disabled person to read and then deliver an appropriate response. The text on the screen can be then comprehended by the hearing disabled person and initiate a seamless communication between the two. The GUI also saves the logs of the conversation for any kind of future reference. Moreover, the Exit Button is used to remnant the GUI. In today's world communication is the key element of progress. Our project can not only make the hearing impaired people communicate effectively but also provide them with jobs.
